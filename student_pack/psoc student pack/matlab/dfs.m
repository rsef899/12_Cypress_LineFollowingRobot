%% This is a shell that you will have to follow strictly. 
% You will use the plotmap() and viewmap() to display the outcome of your algorithm.

% Load sample_data_map_8, three variables will be created in your workspace. These were created as a 
% result of [m,v,s]=dfs('map_8.txt',[14,1],[1,18]);
% The solution can be viewed using 
% plotmap(m,s) 

% write your own function for the DFS algorithm.
function [retmap,retvisited,retsteps] = dfs( mapfile,startlocation,targetlocation)

% This function will plot a insert yellow rectangle and also print a number in this rectangle. Use with plotmap/viewmap. 
position = [16-position(1) position(2)];
